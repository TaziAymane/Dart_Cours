## About this repository
This repository contains my notes, exercises, mini-projects and experiments while completing the Dart course by Wael Abo Hamza. It's organized to be both a study log and a small portfolio of runnable examples demonstrating core Dart concepts.

## What I learned
High-level topics covered in this course (what I studied and practiced):

- Dart installation & environment setup (SDK, editor — VS Code recommended)
- Basic syntax: variables, types, operators
- Control flow: `if`, `switch`, loops (`for`, `while`, `do-while`)
- Functions, optional/named parameters, closures
- Collections: `List`, `Set`, `Map`
- Object-Oriented Programming: classes, constructors, inheritance, mixins, interfaces, abstract classes
- Error handling: `try`, `catch`, `finally`, custom exceptions
- Asynchronous programming: `Future`, `async/await`, `Stream`
- Packages & pub.dev: creating and using packages
- File I/O and simple CLI apps (where applicable)
- Basic testing (unit tests) — if included in projects
- Best practices and project structure
- 
## How to run examples (local)
Prerequisites:
- Install the Dart SDK: https://dart.dev/get-dart
- Recommended editor: VS Code (+ Dart extension)

Common commands:

Run a console program (example):
```bash
# From repo root, for a script in exercises/lesson-03/bin/main.dart
dart run exercises/lesson-03/bin/main.dart

# Or for a package-style project inside projects/my_app:
cd projects/my_app
dart run
